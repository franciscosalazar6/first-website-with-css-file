    <p>We know that in recent years sneaker scalpers have created
        a big problem within the sneakerhead community. Making it difficult for regular day folks to acquire their favorite shoes.
    </p>
    
    <p> We have made it our mission to give the chance to more people to buy the shoes that they have always wanted.
        By recieving donations from private collectors, these shoes will be raffled off at a reasonable price.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Here is our upcoming list of shoes being raffled off this year.</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Air Jordan 1 - "Chicago" colorway</li>
        <li>Air Jordan 11 - "Banned" colorway</li>
        <li>Nike Lebron 8 - "South Beach" colorway</li>
      </ul>  
    <p>(The dates for these upcoming shoes will be announced in the upcoming weeks)</p>
